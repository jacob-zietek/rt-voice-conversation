# Real time voice conversation with GPT

I saw [Figure's robot demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sq1QZB5baNw) and I wanted to figure out how they did real time voice conversations for future projects.

Large chunks of this project was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/davabase/whisper_real_time/tree/master).

Install:
```
git clone https://github.com/jacob-zietek/rt-voice-conversation.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py
```
